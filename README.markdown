What?

By using Ruby's Bindings, I can tell you a lot of stuff :-)


Usage
===

After requiring memory_dump, insert the following line anywhere in your code:

    dump{}

This will give you a nested Hash containing most variables accessible from where you called it, 
as well as a few other interesting tidbits:

    {:instance_variables=>{"@instance_variable"=>"instance var's value"},
     :class=>YourClass,
     :local_variables=>{"local"=>"local var's value"},
     :class_variables=>{"@@class_variable"=>"class var's value"},
     :ancestors=>[YourClass, YourMom, Object],
     :backtrace=>['you_get_the_drift.rb']}

If you're ready for an explosion of (very interesting) information, call it in verbose mode:

    dump(:verbose){}
    dump(:v){}

Included in the previous hash will be an additional hash containing all the global variables 
and their values, as well as an array of all constants accessible from that binding.
